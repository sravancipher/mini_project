## 🧠 Stress Prediction Based on Sleeping Patterns

This machine learning project helps users **predict their stress levels** based on their **sleep behavior and physiological parameters**. The system uses a trained ML model built in Python and a Streamlit-based user interface to provide an interactive experience where users can input their sleep-related data and view stress predictions in real time.

## ✅ Features

* 🔢 **Stress Level Prediction**
  Users can enter their sleeping pattern data and receive a predicted stress level.

* 🩺 **Personalized Health Tips**
  The application suggests helpful wellness tips based on the predicted stress level.

* 📊 **Monitoring Over Time**
  Users can track or recheck their stress levels as their sleep patterns change.
